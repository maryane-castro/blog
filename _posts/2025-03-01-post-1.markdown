Recently, while trying to run an Anaconda environment, I encountered the following error:

```
libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found
```

This error usually occurs when the version of the `libstdc++.so.6` library on your system is not compatible with the Anaconda environment you are using. This type of problem is common when there is an incompatibility between your system's C++ library version and the version expected by Anaconda.

After extensive research, I found a solution on StackOverflow that was the quickest and most efficient way to fix the problem.

### How I solved it:

The proposed solution was to update the symbolic link of the `libstdc++.so.6` library to the correct version within the Anaconda environment. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libstdc++.so.6
```

**Command explanation:**
- `ln -sf`: creates a forced symbolic link, replacing the destination file if it already exists.
- `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6`: is the path to the library version on the system.
- `${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/libstdc++.so.6`: is the path where Anaconda expects to find the library.

This command creates a symbolic link inside your Anaconda environment pointing to the correct library version, resolving the incompatibility.

### How to apply the solution:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Activate the Anaconda environment that is showing the error.
3. Run the command mentioned above.
4. Check if the problem is resolved by running your code again.

### Results:

After running the command, the error was fixed, and I was able to continue my work without any further issues related to this error.
